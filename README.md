# clean-acmart

The original template was intended for submitting papers to ACM conferences, include SOSP, EuroSys, ASPLOS, etc.

This version was developed to solve some issues for FEUP's Processing and Retrieval of Information class.

## Usage

Unlike the original, this is not an official template.

Use the following command on the cli in a Linux system to install the template:
```sh
curl -Ss "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guilherme-ds-matos/clean-acmart/refs/heads/main/install.sh" | bash
```
Then use this command to init the template on your device:
```sh
typst init "@local/clean-acmart:0.0.1"
```
